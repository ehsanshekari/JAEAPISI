## Just Another Express API Structure Implementation

This repository is based on Apress Building APIs with Node.js by Caio Ribeiro Pereira (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484224410). I intend to add some features to make this code more complete and more suitable for more sophisticated real world projects. I appreciate any help that anyone can provide.
